# QS-Project-04
### *NodeJS Express*

**David S. Rummel**

## Overview
Create a solution using the 3-Tier architecture that lets users register and log in to a forum, where
users may ask and answer questions.

**NOTE:**
  *An NPM install will need to be performed at the root level and the react-client level to restore the node_modules*

## Details
Your solution should include:

1. A database schema and some example data. For demoing purposes, choose a free online
database service, or create example files that load an empty database with example data.
2. An application layer written using node.js and express.js. I recommend creating a JSON API
that accesses the database fields and prepares a JSON string for the client
3. A single page application (client-side rich web application) that communicates with the
application layer by sending and receiving JSON data. You may choose the corresponding
frameworks and libraries in the solution.
